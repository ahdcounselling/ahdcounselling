          <h2 id="tagline">Integrative Counselling and Psychotherapy designed to meet your individual needs</h2>
          <p class="lead">I am an experienced and professionally qualified Integrative Counsellor and Psychotherapist currently working within the addiction field, whilst running a private practice in the evenings. I work in and around North and East London &mdash; areas include but are not limited to: Highbury, Whitechapel, Barking.</p>

<p class="lead">As an integrative therapist I work in a Person Centred way, integrating Mindfulness techniques and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, depending on my clients' individual needs.</p>

<p class="lead">I offer a safe, confidential and supportive environment where you can explore and make sense of any challenges that you are facing. It is my belief that many of the behaviours and beliefs that urge us to seek help were once coping mechanisms that have outlived their usefulness. </p>

<p class="lead">Through dialogue, challenging, humour and willingness, therapy can allow for both client and therapist to explore more meaningful ways to live and meet life's challenges.</p>

<p class="lead">I work in a LGBTQ+ friendly and sex positive way and welcome clients looking to address issues around sexuality and gender identity and those in A-typical relationship structures.</p>

        <div class="col-md-6 alert-basic">
          <h3>What is counselling and psychotherapy?</h3>
          <div class="col-md-6 alert-basic">Counselling and psychotherapy are umbrella terms that cover a range of talking therapies. 
        They are delivered by trained practitioners, like myself, who work with people over a short or long term to help them bring about effective change or enhance their wellbeing.
        Therapy is time set aside by you and the therapist to look at what has brought you to therapy. 
        You might use the time to talk about life events, (past and present), feelings, emotions, relationships, ways of thinking and patterns of behaviour. 
        As a therapist, I will do my best to help you to look at your issues, and to identify the right course of action for you, either to help you resolve your difficulties or help you find ways of coping. 
        Talking about these things may take time, and will not necessarily all be included in one session. </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 alert-basic">
    
          <h3>What do sessions cost?</h3>
          <p class="lead"><p class="lead">Sessions last 50 minutes and cost &pound;50. Some low cost places are available so please enquire. Sessions take place either in North or East London and can also be via Skype (ahdcounselling).</p>
